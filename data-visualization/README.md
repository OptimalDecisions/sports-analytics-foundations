# Plotting and Data Visualization Using Python

This folder contains Colab notebooks that cover the very basics of Pandas. (They are intended for self-learning)

The notebooks have an accompanying Exercises Notebook. To be sure that you have understood these concepts, please try the exercises and the challenges.

**Copy the notebooks to your Google Drive** and that way, you can go through each Colab notebook, and try to make changes to your copy.
