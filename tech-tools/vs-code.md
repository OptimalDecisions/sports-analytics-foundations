(Alternatively, you can use Jupyter Notebooks, which runs on your local computer. Colab runs in the "cloud.")


# Installing and Using the VS Code Editor


### Connect git to your VS Code Editor


**Note that you first have to download 'git' for your operating system**

-- How to Download git for your OS (Windows, Mac or Linux)?
    Follow the [instructions given here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


After you have downloaded git, you can follow the steps in this page(https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git). It clearly lays out the steps needed to connect your VS Code instance to gitHub.

You now have two options -- to use the "Source Control" view in VS Code, or to use the built-in terminal that comes with VS Code.

### VS Code Source Control for Git commands

VS Code has made a new overview video that explains this:

### CLI Terminal for Git commands
If you are comfortable with command line tools, you can run git using the ["Built-in Terminal" in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_using-git-in-the-builtin-terminal).
